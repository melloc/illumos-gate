.TH INOTIFY_ADD_WATCH 3C "Sep 17, 2014"
.SH NAME
inotify_add_watch \- add a watch to an inotify instance
.SH SYNOPSIS

.LP
.nf
#include <sys/inotify.h>

\fBint\fR \fBinotify_add_watch\fR(\fBint\fR \fIfd\fR, \fBconst char *\fR\fIpathname\fR, \fBuint32_t\fR \fImask\fR);
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBinotify_add_watch()\fR function adds a watch for the file or
directory specified by \fIpathname\fR to the inotify instance
specified by \fIfd\fR for the events specified by \fImask\fR.  See
\fBinotify\fR(5) for details on the meaning of \fImask\fR, how
it affects the interpretation of \fIpathname\fR, and how
events for the watched file or directory are subsequently
retrieved via \fBread\fR(2).

.SH RETURN VALUES
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fBinotify_add_watch()\fR returns the
watch descriptor associated with the new watch.
If an error occurs, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate
the error.

.ne 2
.na
\fB\fBENOSPC\fR\fR

.SH NOTES
.LP

While the \fBinotify\fR(5) facility is implemented for purposes of
offering compatibility for Linux-borne applications, native
applications may opt to use it instead of (or in addition to) the
\fBPORT_SOURCE_FILE\fR capability of event ports.  See
\fBinotify\fR(5) for details and restrictions.
